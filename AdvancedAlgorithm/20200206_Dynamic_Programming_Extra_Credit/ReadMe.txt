1.Usage of the code
To run this code you can use "python3 knapspack.py" in your terminal

2.The description of the code 
The Knapsack.py contains two implementation of bottom up, top down algorithm.It also contains two instances. For one instance bottom up is much faster, another one is reverse. The difference for those 2 is the capacity size. When capacity size increase the bottom up will be slow, and top down will not be influenced. Since bottom up calculate all the possible situation, but top down only calculate the necessary value in the array.
