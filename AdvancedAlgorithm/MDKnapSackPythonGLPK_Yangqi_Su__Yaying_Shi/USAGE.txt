Run python script first to generate lp file:

python MKSLPgenerator.py number_of_objects size_constraint weight_constraint


Then Run the following:

glpsol --lp MKS_MLP.lp -o result.o

The results will be in result.o file

The program can run quite fast up to 1000000 variables (< 3 minute for weight_constraint =  20000, size_constraint = 100000), however, if weight constraints and size_constraints were increased by a factor of 10, it slows down drastically taking at least over an hour.
