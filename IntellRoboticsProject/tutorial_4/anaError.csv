Numerical and Analytical differences:
Theta1: max: 0.0005, min: -0.0001, average: 0.000132410839
Theta2: max: 0.00026, min: -0.00029, average: -0.0000149343139
Theta3: max: 0.00015, min: -0.00081: average: -0.00012846

Overall analytical solutions a bit more accurate in this case, but are difficult for more complex manipulators. Numerical solutions depends upon a starting configuration and their speed depends on the number of iterations required, furthermore, at singular configurations they are not stable.
